Java Script Timers
===================
=> created using setTimeOut()
=> Schedules a new JavaScript execution job for some time in the future
=> when the delay is up, the job is added to the UI queue

   -> Note : This does not gaurantee excution after the delay, just that job is added to 
              the UI queue and will be excuted at appropriate time.

=> set timeOut doesn't means execute this in 500ms or 400ms, it means add this job to UI tread after 500ms.

=> for complex processing, split up into timed functionality
=> use timers to delay some processing later
